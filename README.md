# EMR--for-data-engineering

In this project I used Amazon Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) for processing large datasets using Apache Spark. It includes a Spark script for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations, AWS command line instructions for setting up and managing the EMR cluster, and a dataset for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Project Structure

spark-etl.py: The main Spark script used for ETL operations.

commands.py: Scripts for AWS EMR cluster setup and management.

data/: Directory containing the dataset used in the ETL process.

## Spark Script

The spark-etl.py is a Python script that uses Apache Spark to perform ETL operations. It reads data from an input directory, processes it by adding a timestamp, and writes the result to an output directory in Parquet format.

## AWS Commands

The commands.py directory has the detailed instructions and necessary scripts to set up and manage an AWS EMR cluster. This includes steps for creating an EMR cluster, configuring necessary services, and submitting Spark jobs.
